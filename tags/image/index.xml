      <description>Hugo has figure shortcode built in, so you can easily add figcaptions or hyperlink rel attributes to images. Documentations can be found here:
https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/#figure
This theme has 3 CSS classes made for figure elements:
 big: images will break the width limit of main content area. left: images will float to the left. right: images will float to the right.  If a figure has no class set, the image will behave just like a normal markdown image: !</description>

      <description>Just define the image URL in the content’s front matter, the featured image will be displayed as the background.
For example:
---images:- https://picsum.photos/1024/768/?random---This is an array, you can set multiple urls, only the first url will be used. These images is also used in Twitter Cards and the Open Graph metadata.</description>
